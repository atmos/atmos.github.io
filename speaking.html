<h2>Everything I know about the Business of Open Source I learned from Indie Hip Hop</h2>
<p>In the fall of 2009 I gave a talk that compared building businesses around
things people love.  It shows off a few indepdent hip hop artists and how they
built a name for themselves.  I gave examples of the growth of independent
labels without large scale promotion and liken it to the VC saturated startup
scene.  The idea was to get people to think that building something they
believed in and were proud of was completely atainable if you build your career
around open source technologies.</p>
